# Lora_ESP8266_MorseCode
In this project, I built a glove-based Morse code communication system using ESP8266 + LoRa modules. By tapping on the gloveâ€™s FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor), the system encodes Morse signals (. and -) and transmits them wirelessly over LoRa. The other node receives the signal and replays it through a buzzer.
